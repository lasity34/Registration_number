## Overview 📝

For this exercise, I created a simple web page that displays a car's registration number plate. The design includes rounded corners, a black border, and a background that can be either yellow or silver-grey.

---

## Setup 🛠️

I organized my project files in a folder called `registration_numbers`. The HTML code is in the `index.html` file, and the CSS is in a separate file called `registration_number.css`, linked to the HTML via a `<link>` element.

## Technologies and Skills Used 💻

### HTML
I used various HTML elements such as inline elements, input elements (text & buttons), and page sectioning elements (div, ul, li, span) to structure the webpage.

### CSS
To style the elements, I used CSS properties for:
- Setting element appearance with `color` and `background-color`.
- Creating rounded corners using `border-radius`.
- Employing the box model for spacing and borders.
- Using floats for layout positioning.

## Core Features 🌟

### Registration Plate Display 🚗
The registration number plate is displayed in a visually appealing manner that mimics real-world plates.

### User Input 🖱️
The page includes input elements for users to interact with, although the core functionality is the display of the static registration plate.

## Deployment 🌐

I deployed the project to GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing.
